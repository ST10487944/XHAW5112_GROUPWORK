This website was created for an organization called Empowering the Nation. The purpose of the site is to help people learn more about the training courses offered to domestic workers and gardeners. The website also includes a fee calculator so users can see how much their total training costs will be.

The design is simple, easy to use, and works well on both computers and mobile phones.
